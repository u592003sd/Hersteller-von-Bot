the attacking robots go straight in line and then 
drop virus in the middle and then continue forward



What we are trying to do currently is to unify the movement 
code and change the target base when required. 

Strategy 1:
Farmers and Attackers

Strategy 2:
H and  V

Strategy 3:
Replacing the Martyr robots.

Strategy 4:


Checks and Suggestions:
Keeping the coordinates integers.

gaps when line robots are killed.

Defence around base.

!!!!!!!4. First, the robots will go to near border, then start their
motion towards far border.
 we will get base coordinates then compare them with 
half of the base dimensions.
